# arduino-firing-angle-control
This project regulates AC voltage by adjusting a TRIAC's firing angle using a microcontroller (Arduino/STM32). It features zero-crossing detection for precise timing, voltage feedback via ZMPT101B for stability, and manual or automatic control. Applications include dimmers, motor speed, and temperature control.
